/////////////////////////// Behavioral Interview Questions ///////////////////////////


1) Tell me a little bit about yourself:

    "They need to answer this question with their Elevator pitch: (past - their background, present - how they found Lambda what they’re learning at Lambda a good time to humblebrag about technical skills, future - tie in background and new skills to talk about potential future job)"

    I repeated myself too many times and had a few pauses that were longer than I would have liked.

    - 30 sec to 1 min Elevator pitch

    - Talk about
        - Personal life breifly
        - How I found Lambda School
        - Maybe bring up the why
        - Humble brag about technical skills
        - 


2) What kind of work environment are you looking for in the next opportunity you take?:

    "Be specific, know about what you want in terms of company culture, size, mentor, etc…try to rope in some specifics about the company (you should have some background on them)"

    - Be specific about what you want
    - Bring up things that relate to the company



3) What are your strengths and weaknesses as a developer?:

    "First way to answer this question is to name a weakness that’s not really a weakness i.e. - “I’m too much of a perfectionist” etc... Second way is to actually provide a weakness but then without being prompted provide how you’re going to FIX the weakness"





Steve: Spoke really fast

Sheila: Lighting could have been better

Bradley: Lost his groove, could smile more. Nailed it the second time.

Jose: Did well. I started taking notes too late and don't remember too much. I do remember the previous jobs though! Currently a lawer and previously a professional poker player. Mentioning them really made him stand out.
