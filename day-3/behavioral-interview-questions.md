/////////////////////////// Behavioral Interview Questions ///////////////////////////


1) Why should we hire you?
    - Another good opportunity to up sale your tech/soft skills - you should have an idea of what the job description is that you’re interviewing for so rope in some of those qualifications here - Your job here is to craft an answer that covers three things: that you can not only do the work, you can deliver great results; that you’ll really fit in with the team and culture; and that you’d be a better hire than any of the other candidates.


2) How would your co-workers describe you?
    - Up sell your soft skills here, be careful about being overly arrogant sounding or too cheesy.


3) Can you explain why you changed career paths?
    - Explain to the hiring manager why you’ve made the career decisions you have. More importantly, give a few examples of how your past experience is transferable to the new role. This doesn’t have to be a direct connection; in fact, it’s often more impressive when a candidate can make seemingly irrelevant experience seem very relevant to the role. But also SHOW YOUR PASSION FOR ENGINEERING!

4) How do you deal with pressure or stressful situations?
    - A great approach is to talk through your go-to stress-reduction tactics (making the world’s greatest to-do list, stopping to take 10 deep breaths), and then share an example of a stressful situation you navigated with ease.
