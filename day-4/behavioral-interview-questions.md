/////////////////////////// Behavioral Interview Questions ///////////////////////////


1) What are your salary requirements?
    -You should always start off by saying you’re more interested in the opportunity and if it’s the right one you’re willing to be flexible - you don’t have to give them a number right then and there. IF they are pushing you for an actual # then the #1 rule of answering this question is doing your research on what you should be paid by using sites like Glassdoor. Formula to use: walk away rate + 10k and a 20k range from there: 60k + 10k = 70k so the range would be 70k-90k. Then, make sure the hiring manager knows that you’re flexible. You’re communicating that you know your skills are valuable, but that you want the job and are willing to negotiate.


2) Give an example of a goal you reached and tell me how you achieved it?
    - Time to humble brag about yourself a bit - use the STAR method here, tell them about a situation/obstacle/challenge you had in terms of a goal - tell them how you went about systematically breaking this down as if you were an engineer piece by piece, then tell them the results.
